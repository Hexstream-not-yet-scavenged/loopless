Loopless contains utilities that provide a compelling alternative to
LOOP for the vast majority of its use-cases. Most of these utilities
are straightforward to learn and use, and are consistent in style with
other standard Common Lisp constructs. All of them are easily
composable with the rest of the language, unlike LOOP's monolithic
approach.
